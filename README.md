### Bio
Emily Dobry is a masters candidate in the College of Agricultural Sciences at Penn State University. Her current research focuses on domestically isolated strains of the emerging fungal pathogen _Gnomoniopsis castaneae_ and their effect on members of the Fagaceae family. Specifically, she is interested in investigating host specificity of the fungus and describing the domestic strains in relation to internationally isolated strains.
